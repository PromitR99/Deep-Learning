The main steps for building a Neural Network are:

1. Define the model structure (such as number of input features)
2. Initialize the model's parameters
3. Loop:
   - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
   - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
   - Update parameters (gradient descent)
You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call model().
