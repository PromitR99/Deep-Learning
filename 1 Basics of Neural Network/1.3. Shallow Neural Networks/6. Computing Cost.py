def compute_cost(A2, Y, parameters):
    """
    Computes the cross-entropy cost given in equation (13)
    
    Arguments:
    A2 -- The sigmoid output of the second activation, of shape (1, number of examples)
    Y -- "true" labels vector of shape (1, number of examples)
    parameters -- python dictionary containing your parameters W1, b1, W2 and b2
    [Note that the parameters argument is not used in this function, 
    but the auto-grader currently expects this parameter.
    Future version of this notebook will fix both the notebook 
    and the auto-grader so that `parameters` is not needed.
    For now, please include `parameters` in the function signature,
    and also when invoking this function.]

Using the cache computed during forward propagation, you can now implement backward propagation.

Question: Implement the function backward_propagation().

Instructions: Backpropagation is usually the hardest (most mathematical) part in deep learning. To help you, here again is the slide from the lecture on backpropagation. You'll want to use the six equations on the right of this slide, since you are building a vectorized implementation.
