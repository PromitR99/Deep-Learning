3 - Random initialization
To break symmetry, lets intialize the weights randomly. Following random initialization, each neuron can then proceed to learn a different function of its inputs.
In this exercise, you will see what happens if the weights are intialized randomly, but to very large values.

Exercise: Implement the following function to initialize your weights to large random values (scaled by *10) and your biases to zeros.
Use np.random.randn(..,..) * 10 for weights and np.zeros((.., ..)) for biases.
We are using a fixed np.random.seed(..) to make sure your "random" weights match ours, so don't worry if running several times your code gives you always the same initial values for the parameters.

If you see "inf" as the cost after the iteration 0, this is because of numerical roundoff; a more numerically sophisticated implementation would fix this. But this isn't worth worrying about for our purposes.

Anyway, it looks like you have broken symmetry, and this gives better results. than before. The model is no longer outputting all 0s.

Observations:

1. The cost starts very high. This is because with large random-valued weights, the last activation (sigmoid) outputs results that are very close to 0 or 1 for some examples, and when it gets that example wrong it incurs a very high loss for that example.
Indeed, when log(a^[3]) = log(0), the loss goes to infinity.
2. Poor initialization can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients, which also slows down the optimization algorithm.
3. If you train this network longer you will see better results, but initializing with overly large random numbers slows down the optimization.
